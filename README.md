## Proposed Challenge:

Create a Javascript application in which you can simulate controlling a robot. The robot should be placed on a 5x5 grid. Supply controls that let you move the robot forwards in the direction it is facing, and rotate the robot in place to face any cardinal direction. Use any Javascript framework you’re comfortable with, as long as it runs in modern web browsers (we’re not looking for backwards compatibility in this test).

### Instructions:

In order to run the application you will need to download the repository and run the following commands

- run `npm i` to install all the required dependencies and packages.
- run `npm start` to start the application on a local host server.
- navigate to specifed localhost link that you can see in your IDE/terminal

### Tools, Libraries and Frameworks utilised

- React
- Styled Components
- Typescript instead of JS.
- ParcelJS for bundling and building the application
